a)	Find the following parametric information about the population. The degree of freedom for this population is 0. That is, variance is calculated by dividing by the length N of the dataset.

Show: <br />
•	The number of datapoints in the population. <br />
•	Minimum value <br />
•	Maximum value <br />
•	The mean <br />
•	The 25% Quartile <br />
•	The 75% Quartile <br />
•	The Interquartile range <br />
•	The lower outlier limit from the interquartile range <br />
•	The upper outlier limit from the interquartile range <br />
•	The count of the number of outliers in the population. <br />

b)	Use a random number generator to sample 1000 data points from the population. This sample is the 1000 Unit Sample. Find the following statistical information about the sample. The degree of freedom for this sample is 1. That is, variance is calculated by dividing by the length N of the data set -1.

Show: <br />
•	The number of datapoints in the 1000 Unit Sample. <br />
•	Minimum value <br />
•	Maximum value <br />
•	The mean <br />
•	The 25% Quartile <br />
•	The 75% Quartile <br />
•	The Interquartile range <br />
•	The lower outlier limit from the interquartile range <br />
•	The upper outlier limit from the interquartile range <br />
•	The count of the number of outliers in the 1000 Unit Sample. <br />

Conclusion (b - c):
As we can see, the statistics start to converge as the size of the sample increases.
